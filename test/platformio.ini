[env:esp8266]
platform = espressif8266
board = nodemcuv2
framework = arduino
test_speed = 74880  ; Setting to 74880 removed garbled output when testing

lib_deps =
  TestFlipDotMatrix ; Added manually because PIO wouldn't compile with symlink (but would with file://)
  Unity
  symlink://../     ; It's better to use a symlink for development
                    ; so that the latest library changes are always pulled in

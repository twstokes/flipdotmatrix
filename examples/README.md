## Examples

These samples were built on a *nix system with an ESP8266 and PlatformIO. If using another environment and/or board, changes will need to be made to the `platformio.ini` configuration.

PlatformIO is not required to use this library, this is just for convenience. See the [docs](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/).

### Compiling examples

### Compiling and uploading
